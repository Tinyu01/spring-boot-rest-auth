# Deployment Instructions for Spring Security Demo

This document provides instructions for deploying the Spring Security Demo application.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure that you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher installed.
- Apache Maven installed.
- Access to a server or cloud environment where you can deploy the application.

## Build the Application

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project:
   ```
   cd /path/to/spring-security-demo
   ```

2. Build the application using Maven:
   ```
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```

   This command will compile the code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file located in the `target` directory.

## Deployment Steps

### Deploying to a Local Server

1. Run the application locally using the following command:
   ```
   java -jar target/spring-security-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

2. Access the application in your web browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Deploying to a Remote Server

1. Copy the JAR file to your remote server using SCP or any file transfer method:
   ```
   scp target/spring-security-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar user@remote-server:/path/to/deploy/
   ```

2. SSH into your remote server:
   ```
   ssh user@remote-server
   ```

3. Navigate to the deployment directory:
   ```
   cd /path/to/deploy/
   ```

4. Run the application on the server:
   ```
   java -jar spring-security-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

5. Ensure that the application is running by accessing it in your web browser:
   ```
   http://remote-server-ip:8080
   ```

## Additional Configuration

- If you need to configure environment variables or application properties, you can do so by creating a `application.properties` file in the same directory as the JAR file or by passing them as command-line arguments.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Monitor the application logs to ensure it is running smoothly. Logs will be printed to the console by default. You can redirect them to a file if needed:
  ```
  java -jar spring-security-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar > app.log 2>&1 &
  ```

## Conclusion

You have successfully deployed the My Java App application. For further assistance, refer to the documentation or contact the development team.
