# Testing Guidelines for My Java Application

This document provides guidelines for testing the My Java Application. It covers unit testing, integration testing, and best practices to ensure the application functions as intended.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are essential for verifying the functionality of individual components. The application uses JUnit for unit testing. 

### Writing Unit Tests

- Place unit tests in the `src/test/java/org/amazon/example` directory.
- Each class should have a corresponding test class. For example, `UserService` should have a `UserServiceTest` class.
- Use meaningful names for test methods to describe the behavior being tested.

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```
./mvnw test
```

## Integration Testing

Integration tests verify the interaction between different components of the application. 

### Writing Integration Tests

- Place integration tests in the `src/test/java/org/amazon/example/integration` directory.
- Ensure that integration tests cover scenarios that involve multiple components working together.

### Running Integration Tests

To run the integration tests, use the following command:

```
./mvnw verify
```

## Best Practices

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Aim for high code coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over quantity.
- Use mocking frameworks like Mockito to isolate components during testing.
- Regularly run tests to catch issues early in the development process.

## Conclusion

Following these testing guidelines will help maintain the quality and reliability of the My Java Application. Regular testing is crucial for identifying issues and ensuring that the application meets its requirements.
